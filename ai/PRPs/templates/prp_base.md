name: "Base PRP Template v2 - Context-Rich with Validation Loops"
description: |

## Purpose
Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative refinement.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal
[What needs to be built - be specific about the end state and desires]

## Why
- [Business value and user impact]
- [Integration with existing features]
- [Problems this solves and for whom]

## What
[User-visible behavior and technical requirements]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcomes]

## All Needed Context

### Documentation & References (list all context needed to implement the feature)
```yaml
# MUST READ - Include these in your context window
- url: [Official API docs URL]
  why: [Specific sections/methods you'll need]
  
- file: [path/to/go.py]
  why: [Pattern to follow, gotchas to avoid]
  
- doc: [Library documentation URL] 
  section: [Specific section about common pitfalls]
  critical: [Key insight that prevents common errors]

- docfile: [PRPs/ai_docs/file.md]
  why: [docs that the user has pasted in to the project]

```

### Current Codebase tree (run `tree` in the root of the project) to get an overview of the codebase
```bash

```

### Desired Codebase tree with files to be added and responsibility of file
```bash

```

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks
```go
# CRITICAL: [Library name] requires [specific setup]
# Example: FastAPI requires async functions for endpoints
# Example: This ORM doesn't support batch inserts over 1000 records
# Example: We use pydantic v2 and  
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

Create the core data models, we ensure type safety and consistency.
```go
Examples: 
 - ent models
 - go generate ./...
```

### list of tasks to be completed to fullfill the PRP in the order they should be completed

```yaml
Task 1:
MODIFY src/existing_module.py:
  - FIND pattern: "class OldImplementation"
  - INJECT after line containing "def __init__"
  - PRESERVE existing method signatures

CREATE src/new_feature.py:
  - MIRROR pattern from: src/similar_feature.py
  - MODIFY class name and core logic
  - KEEP error handling pattern identical

...(...)

Task N:
...

```


### Per task pseudocode as needed added to each task
```go

# Task 1
# Pseudocode with CRITICAL details dont write entire code

```

### Integration Points
```yaml
DATABASE:
  - migration: "Add column 'feature_enabled' to users table"
  - index: "CREATE INDEX idx_feature_lookup ON users(feature_id)"
  
CONFIG:
  - add to: config/config.go
  - pattern: "FEATURE_TIMEOUT = int(os.getenv('FEATURE_TIMEOUT', '30'))"
  
ROUTES:
  - add to: internal/routes/router.go  
  - pattern: "router.include_router(feature_router, prefix='/feature')"
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style
```bash
# Run these FIRST - fix any errors before proceeding
golangci-lint run ./...

# Expected: No errors. If errors, READ the error and fix.
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests each new feature/file/function use existing test patterns
```go
# CREATE test_feature_test.go with these test cases:
```
tests := []struct {
	name           string
	campusID       string
	queryParams    map[string]string
	expectedStatus int
}{}

for _, tt := range tests {
			t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
				resp, err := testSuite.HTTPHelper.MakeGetRequest(
					testCtx,
					"/api/web/campuses/"+tt.campusID+"/buses",
					testSuite.GetAdminUserID(),
					tt.queryParams,
				)
				require.NoError(t, err)

				testSuite.ResponseHelper.AssertStatusCode(t, resp, tt.expectedStatus)

				if tt.expectedStatus == http.StatusOK {
					var dataResp output.DataResp
					testSuite.ResponseHelper.AssertJSONResponse(t, resp, &dataResp)
					assert.NotNil(t, dataResp.Data)
				}
			})
		}
```bash
# Run and iterate until passing:
uv run pytest test_new_feature.py -v
# If failing: Read error, understand root cause, fix code, re-run (never mock to pass)
```

### Level 3: Integration Test
Service already start with docker in local.
```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/feature \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"param": "test_value"}'

# Expected: {"status": "success", "data": {...}}
# If error: Check logs at logs/app.log for stack trace
```

## Final validation Checklist
- [ ] All tests which related with these changes: `go test ./...`
- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run ./...`
- [ ] Manual test successful: [specific curl/command]
- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Logs are informative but not verbose
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't create new patterns when existing ones work
- ❌ Don't skip validation because "it should work"  
- ❌ Don't ignore failing tests - fix them
- ❌ Don't use sync functions in async context
- ❌ Don't hardcode values that should be config
- ❌ Don't catch all exceptions - be specific
